MyriadSwitcher
==============

A Myriadcoin Auto-switching mining software.

MyriadSwitcher is a python app to mine the wonderful crypto-currency known as Myriadcoin. Unlike most cryptos out there, Myriadcoin uses 5 different algorithms to mine the coin, namely SHA-256, Scrypt, Groestl, Skein and Qubit.
MyriadSwitcher fetches the web to determine which of the 4 GPU profitable algos to mine (Scrypt, Groestl, Skein or Qubit). You can aim for maximum coins per day, maximum coins per watt, or mine in an hybrid mode that's anything in between the former modes.
It also monitors your miners and automatically restarts them if they crash or freeze, and can generate an html output log to monitor your mining progress from anywhere.
